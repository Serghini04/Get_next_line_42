## About
The goal of this project is to create the function `get_next_line.c` which, when called in a loop, will read one line at a time in the __file descriptor__, until the end of the file. As stated in the subject, the program must compile with the `flag-D BUFFER_SIZE=` which will be used as the buffer size for the `read` calls in `get_next_line()`.

This project is a introduction of __static variables__, which will be very useful for future projects. Also, as noted earlier, we'll learn how handle macros during compilation.
